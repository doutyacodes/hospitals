# ✅ Recall Functionality - FINAL FIX

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: ❌ Recall Was Excluding No-Show Patients
**Problem**:
- No-Show API set `status = 'no_show'` and `missedAppointment = true`
- Recall logic checked for `status = 'confirmed'` AND `missedAppointment = false`
- **Result**: No-show patients were EXCLUDED from recall!

**Solution**:
- No-Show API now keeps `status = 'confirmed'` (only sets `missedAppointment = true`)
- Recall logic now checks for `missedAppointment = true` (to find no-shows)
- **Result**: No-show patients are now INCLUDED in recall ✅

### Issue 2: ❌ No Recall After "No More Appointments"
**Problem**:
- When all regular appointments were done, system said "No more appointments"
- Missed patients were never recalled

**Solution**:
- Added logic: When no more new appointments, check for missed tokens
- If missed tokens exist, recall them one by one
- **Result**: Missed patients are recalled even after all appointments are done ✅

### Issue 3: ✅ Patient Shows Up After Being Marked No-Show
**Solution**:
- When patient clicks "Start" on recalled appointment
- Clear `missedAppointment = false` (they showed up!)
- Mark `attendedAfterRecall = true`
- **Result**: Patient can be consulted normally after showing up late ✅

## How It Works Now

### Flow Example

```
Token #1 → Complete ✅
Token #2 → No Show ❌ (missedAppointment = true, status = confirmed)
Token #3 → Complete ✅
Token #4 → Complete ✅
Token #5 → Complete ✅
Token #6 → Complete ✅ (5 completed since last recall)

Call Next:
  → Check: (5 - 0) >= 5? YES!
  → Find missed: Token #2 (missedAppointment = true, actualStartTime = NULL)
  → Recall Token #2 🔁
  → lastRecallAt = 5

Token #2 → Patient shows up!
  → Click "Start" → missedAppointment = false, attendedAfterRecall = true
  → Complete normally ✅

Token #7 → Complete ✅
... continue until Token #20

Call Next (after Token #20):
  → No more confirmed appointments with tokenNumber > 20
  → Check for ANY missed tokens
  → If found: Recall them
  → If none: "No more appointments for today"
```

### Recall Trigger Conditions

**During Normal Flow** (Before running out of appointments):
```javascript
if (recallEnabled && totalCompleted > 0 && (totalCompleted - lastRecallAt) >= recallInterval) {
  // Find missed tokens that are:
  // - missedAppointment = true
  // - actualStartTime = NULL (not started yet)
  // - status != 'completed'
  // - tokenNumber < currentToken

  if (missedTokens.length > 0) {
    return recallAppointment; // Recall first missed
  }
}
```

**After Running Out of Appointments**:
```javascript
if (nextAppointments.length === 0) {
  // Check for ANY missed tokens
  const allMissedTokens = await db.select()
    .where(
      missedAppointment = true,
      actualStartTime = NULL,
      status != 'completed'
    );

  if (allMissedTokens.length > 0) {
    return recallAppointment; // Recall first missed
  }

  return "No more appointments for today";
}
```

## Files Changed

### 1. `/api/doctor/consultation/no-show/route.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
await db.update(appointments).set({
  status: 'no_show', // ❌ This excluded from recall
  missedAppointment: true,
  ...
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
await db.update(appointments).set({
  // status stays 'confirmed' ✅
  missedAppointment: true,
  tokenStatus: 'missed',
  ...
});
```

### 2. `/api/doctor/consultation/next/route.js`

**Before** (Recall Check):
```javascript
eq(appointments.status, 'confirmed'), // ❌
eq(appointments.missedAppointment, false) // ❌ Excluded no-shows!
```

**After** (Recall Check):
```javascript
eq(appointments.missedAppointment, true), // ✅ Find no-shows!
sql`${appointments.status} != 'completed'`, // ✅ Exclude completed
```

**Added** (After No More Appointments):
```javascript
if (nextAppointments.length === 0) {
  // NEW: Check for missed tokens
  const allMissedTokens = await db.select()...

  if (allMissedTokens.length > 0) {
    return recallAppointment; // ✅ Recall missed
  }

  return "No more appointments";
}
```

### 3. `/api/doctor/consultation/start/route.js`

**Added**:
```javascript
const updateData = {
  actualStartTime: timeStr,
  consultationStartedAt: now,
  missedAppointment: false, // ✅ Clear flag when they show up
  updatedAt: now,
};

if (appointment.isRecalled) {
  updateData.attendedAfterRecall = true; // ✅ Track late arrivals
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Normal Recall After Interval
1. ✅ Complete tokens #1, #2, #3
2. ✅ Mark #4 as No Show
3. ✅ Complete tokens #5, #6, #7, #8, #9
4. ✅ Call next (after 5th completed: #9)
5. **Expected**: Token #4 is recalled 🔁
6. **Verify**: Toast shows "🔁 Recalling Token #4"

### Test 2: Patient Shows Up After No-Show
1. ✅ Mark Token #5 as No Show
2. ✅ Complete 5 more tokens
3. ✅ Token #5 is recalled
4. ✅ Patient arrives, click "Start" on Token #5
5. **Expected**: Consultation starts normally
6. **Verify**: `missedAppointment = false`, `attendedAfterRecall = true`

### Test 3: Recall After All Appointments Done
1. ✅ Process all 20 tokens
2. ✅ Mark tokens #3, #7, #12 as No Show
3. ✅ Complete all others (17 completed)
4. ✅ Recalls happen at intervals (5, 10, 15)
5. ✅ After token #20, click "Call Next"
6. **Expected**: Token #3 is recalled (or whichever is still missed)
7. ✅ If still no-show, click next
8. **Expected**: Token #7 is recalled
9. ✅ Continue until all missed are recalled or completed
10. **Expected**: Finally shows "No more appointments for today"

### Test 4: Multiple Recalls of Same Token
1. ✅ Mark Token #6 as No Show
2. ✅ Complete 5 tokens → Recall #6
3. ✅ Mark #6 as No Show again
4. ✅ Complete 5 more tokens → Recall #6 again
5. **Expected**: Token #6 recalled multiple times
6. **Verify**: `recallCount` increments each time

## Database State

### No-Show Appointment
```sql
{
  tokenNumber: 4,
  status: 'confirmed', -- ✅ Not 'no_show'
  missedAppointment: true, -- ✅ Marked as missed
  actualStartTime: NULL, -- ✅ Not started yet
  isRecalled: false, -- Initially
  recallCount: 0
}
```

### After Recall
```sql
{
  tokenNumber: 4,
  status: 'confirmed',
  missedAppointment: true,
  actualStartTime: NULL,
  isRecalled: true, -- ✅ Marked as recalled
  recallCount: 1, -- ✅ Incremented
  lastRecalledAt: '2025-10-08 10:45:00'
}
```

### After Patient Shows Up
```sql
{
  tokenNumber: 4,
  status: 'completed', -- ✅ After completion
  missedAppointment: false, -- ✅ Cleared when started
  actualStartTime: '10:46', -- ✅ Set when started
  attendedAfterRecall: true, -- ✅ Tracked
  consultationStartedAt: '2025-10-08 10:46:00',
  consultationEndedAt: '2025-10-08 11:00:00'
}
```

---

## Key Changes Summary

1. ✅ **No-Show keeps status = 'confirmed'** (so it can be found for recall)
2. ✅ **Recall checks missedAppointment = true** (finds no-shows)
3. ✅ **After all appointments, recall missed tokens** (no patient left behind)
4. ✅ **Start consultation clears missedAppointment** (patient showed up)
5. ✅ **Track attendedAfterRecall** (know who came late)

---

## What Happens Now

### Scenario: Complete All 20 Tokens with 3 No-Shows

```
Process tokens 1-20:
  #1 ✅, #2 ✅, #3 ❌, #4 ✅, #5 ✅
  #6 ✅, #7 ❌, #8 ✅, #9 ✅, #10 ✅
  #11 ✅, #12 ❌, #13 ✅, #14 ✅, #15 ✅
  #16 ✅, #17 ✅, #18 ✅, #19 ✅, #20 ✅

After 5 completed (#5): Recall #3 🔁
  → If shows up: Complete
  → If no-show: Continue

After 10 completed (#10): Recall #3 or #7 🔁
  → Process accordingly

After 15 completed (#15): Recall remaining missed 🔁

After 20 completed (#20): Call Next
  → "No more confirmed appointments with tokenNumber > 20"
  → Check for missed tokens
  → Recall #3, #7, or #12 (whichever still missed) 🔁
  → Keep recalling until all are done or confirmed no-show

Final: "No more appointments for today" ✅
```

## Migration Already Run

✅ Columns added:
- `current_token` (INT, default 0)
- `last_recall_at` (INT, default 0)

If you get errors about missing columns, run:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/migrate
```

## Summary

✅ **Recall now works correctly!**
- No-show patients ARE included in recall
- Recalls happen at intervals (every 5 completed)
- After all appointments done, missed tokens are recalled
- Patients can show up late and be consulted
- System tracks everything properly

**Test it now and it should work perfectly!** 🎉
